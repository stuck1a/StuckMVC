<h1>StuckMVC (Alpha Preview)</h1>

<strong>Lightweight PSR compilant MVC framwork.
Fully extendable.
Uses Smarty as template engine (only 3rd party package)</strong>

<i>Focuses on beginners, allowing to build professional websites without being dependant from
expensive providers like WP, Joomla, ... - but will also have a lot to offer for professional developers as well.</i>

<strong>100% state of the art:</strong>
- composer-ready
- support for modules
- DBAL: database/"filebase" support
- custom cache system
- custom, highly flexible model (wip!) and controller system
- support for components
- complies with common development patterns
- support for most widget structures
- multilanguage support
- huge backend (DBMS, CMS, ...) - it even enables development of new controllers and templates!
- fully scalable (from small homepages up to large enterprise websites or complex webapplications)
- comes with default themes, but supports development of own themes as well
- debug mode
- custom request handling
- differs between local and live enviroments and more - no need for docker anymore!
- many many more...


This project is currently under development.
Since the core features are mostly done, it MIGHT be used to build webapplications already,
but it's highly recommend to wait until official release of v1.0!

<strong>//Edit: Due to the whole rebuild of the model system (mixin of active record pattern), absolutely don't use the current build !!!</strong>


Planned release of v1.0 -> June/July 2022
Be prepared :)
