<h1>StuckMVC (Alpha Preview)</h1>

<strong>Lightweight PSR compilant MVC framwork.
Fully extendable.
Uses Smarty as template engine</strong>

<i>Focuses on less-expirienced web developers, allowing then to build professional websites through high abstraction
without being dependant from expensive providers like WP, Joomla, ... - but the framework will also have a lot to offer
for professional developers as well.</i>

<strong>100% state of the art:</strong>
- composer-ready
- support for modules
- DBAL: database/"filebase" support
- custom psr4 cache system
- custom, highly flexible model (wip!) and controller system
- support for custom components
- complies with common development patterns
- support for common widget structures
- multilanguage support
- huge backend (DBMS, CMS, ...) - it even enables development of new controllers and templates!
- fully scalable (from small homepages up to large enterprise websites or complex web applications)
- comes with default themes (classic/modern), but supports development of own themes as well
- debug mode
- custom request handling
- differs between local, stage and live environments - no need for docker containers anymore!
- many many more...


This project is currently under development.
Since the core features are mostly done, it <i>might</i> be used to build web applications already,
but it's highly recommend to wait until official release of v1.0!

<strong>//Edit: Due to the current WIP of the model system overhaul (mixin of active record pattern),
usage of the current build is strongly discouraged!</strong>
